Basic EDA, check for unique and null values to clean data 
Find and Visualise Ratio of Claim to No Claim (Response Variable)
Imbalanced Data Set so perform downsampling to reduce class imbalance (What is the explanation for this) 
Find Numeric Data types 
Why choose to drop certain fields? (I guess the ones dropped are categorical data fields with numeric data types, not sure if need explain)
EDA through histograms (If its not easily viewable via the notebook still can anot ah) 
Dk the idea of just comparing averages accross both data sets seems sus, not sure if theres a btr way to do it
We want to show that for certain Categorical Variables, there is a big diff between is claim and no claim. Not sure if heatmap is the way to go for this cause its not very clear from the heatmap if there is an imbalance
