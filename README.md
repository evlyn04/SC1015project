## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict if an insurance claim will be filed in the next 6 months based on the policyholder's attributes?


## Models Used

1. Naive Bayes Classification
2. Random Forest
3. Voting Classifier

## Conclusion

- Basic EDA, check for unique and null values to clean data 
- Find and Visualise Ratio of Claim to No Claim (Response Variable)
- Imbalanced Data Set so perform downsampling to reduce class imbalance (What is the explanation for this) 
- Find Numeric Data types 
- Why choose to drop certain fields? (I guess the ones dropped are categorical data fields with numeric data types, not sure if need explain)
- EDA through histograms (If its not easily viewable via the notebook still can anot ah) 
- Dk the idea of just comparing averages accross both data sets seems sus, not sure if theres a btr way to do it
- We want to show that for certain Categorical Variables, there is a big diff between is claim and no claim. Not sure if heatmap is the way - to go for this cause its not very clear from the heatmap if there is an imbalance
